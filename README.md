# Servientrega-Scrap
Small python script to scrape information from a delivery package of Servientrega
This project is unofficial Servienrega and this script only

English | Spanish

## How it works
This is a basic code that makes asynchronous requests to the servientrega API to obtain public information about a servientrega package.
I made this script because the delivery webpage works very poorly, in addition, it has a meaningless "captcha" that can be bypassed without any problem.

## It's not finished yet
This script is not completed, and only shows very basic information about a package, the script will be improved to obtain all the available information, such as identity cards, estimated value, identification codes and images about the packages.

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to this repository, all you need is to know a little about Python, HTTP requests and possibly Web Scraping.
If you are a person who is starting out, do not be afraid to make any contribution, no matter how minimal the contribution may be, thank you very much.

## Usage

I am not responsible for the misuse of this tool, this script only automates the obtaining of public information about service delivery packages.
